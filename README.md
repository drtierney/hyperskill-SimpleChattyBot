Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console

**Stage #2: How old are you?**   
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age

**Stage #3: Let’s count!**   
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply the for-loop at this stage!

**Stage #4: The student and the teacher**   
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple choice questions. Add some methods to your code and make the stage even better
